      <h2 class="card-title">Roots</h2>
      <p class="card-description">My name is Bryan and I was born in Mexico City, Mexico. Although I was born in one of
        the biggest cities in the world, I was raised in a very small town called San jose, Queretaro. My family moved
        to the United States in 2005 when I was 9 years old. Ever since, I've lived in
        Iowa</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Professional Background</h2>
      <p class="card-description">My background is in the medical field. After graduating high school, I started working
        at the Emergency Department in my local Hospital with the title of Emergency Technician. I spent several years
        in that role while pursuing a nursing degree. <br><br> When I discovered software development, I realized a
        nursing
        role
        was not meant for me. However, I hope to one day combine my medical skills and knowledge with software
        engineering.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Lily and Lyla</h2>
      <p class="card-description">As many pet owners would relate, my girls Lily and Lyla are my world. There is no
        love, like the type we receive from our dogs. One of my biggest motivations as I pursue a career in software
        enginnering, is to be able to give these pups the life they deserve. That means, a nice house with a big
        backyard.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Goals</h2>
      <p class="card-description">I walk this trail everyday. The main reason is because I love the neighborhood.
        Walking by so many beautiful houses, I think about the type of life I want to live. <br><br>Even though I'm the
        first
        person in my family to pursue a higher education, I've been blessed with parents that have showed me what it
        means to work hard in life. I've found a true passion in software engineering and I want to work hard to be able
        to live in a beautiful neighbood like this one day.</p>
